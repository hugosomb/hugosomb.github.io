<h1>4. Who should I vote for?!</h1>
<p>Despite all the information thrown at you so far, chances are, if you were to 
go to the polling centre right now, you'd still be fucked.</p>
<p>Yes, you know how to vote, and when and where to do it, but you probably 
haven't got the slightest clue about who's on the ballot, beyond perhaps the 
major parties. But don't worry; this section has got you covered.</p>
<p>This aims to be a concise summary of the policies of the parties 
contesting this election, and to also help you find information on independents 
contesting this election.</p>
<h2>Who's running?</h2>
<p>Nominations for the election haven't yet closed, so there's no official list 
of candidates (though they will be added here once available from the A.E.C.).</p>
<p>The <em>Guardian</em>'s
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2022/apr/10/australian-election-2022-seat-explorer">
seat explorer tool</a> mentioned in part 1 can unofficially show you House of 
Representatives candidates, 
as well as useful historical data, margins, and demographics.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has an article on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidates_of_the_2022_Australian_federal_election#Victoria">
candidates of the 2022 federal election</a>, which includes a list of Senate 
candidates towards the bottom.</p>
<p>Looking for info on your current MPs and senators? <a href="https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/">They Vote For You</a> is an 
invaluable insight into the way they vote in Parliament. You can type in your 
postcode or seat and view information on attendance and their position on a range of policy areas. It's a bit harder to look up current serving senators, but 
you can also find them using
<a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian_Search_Results?q=&amp;sta=VIC&amp;sen=1">
Parliament's directory</a> and input their names directly into the <em>They Vote 
For You</em> search bar.</p>
<h2>But what about their policies?</h2>
<p>Strap on in! Although we don't have an official ballot that we can use to 
create our own informed ranking yet, it pays well to have a read of each party's 
platforms.</p>
<p>This section is currently a work-in-progress; as party pages are completed, 
their links will appear here.</p>
