<h1>4. Who should I vote for?!</h1>
<p>Despite all the information thrown at you so far, chances are, if you were to 
go to the polling centre right now, you'd still be fucked.</p>
<p>Yes, you know how to vote, and when and where to do it, but you probably 
haven't got the slightest clue about who's on the ballot. You might not even 
know what the major parties are. Hell, you might not even know what a <em>party</em> 
is. But don't worry; this section has got you covered.</p>
<h2>What's a ‘party’?</h2>
<p>A <em>party</em> is a political organisation of people who broadly share the 
same political aims and which competes in elections. Most candidates belong to 
parties, though some choose to compete as an <em>independent</em>.</p>
<p>In most countries around the world, there usually exist two <em>major parties</em> 
for each side of the <em>left-right spectrum</em> (though arguably, this 
spectrum and its derivatives are complete rubbish as they apply overly reductive 
and simplistic labels to parties with often complex views). In Australia, they 
are the centre-left Australian Labor Party, and the centre-right coalition of 
the Liberal and National Parties (or the Coalition).</p>
<p>In addition, there are a number of <em>minor parties</em>, who generally do 
not form government but still win seats, and <em>microparties</em>, which tend 
to not win any seats at all and often focus on single issues.</p>
<h2>Who's running?</h2>
<p>Nominations for the election haven't yet closed, so there's no official list 
of candidates (though they will be added here once available from the A.E.C.).</p>
<p>The <em>Guardian</em>'s
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2022/apr/10/australian-election-2022-seat-explorer">
seat explorer tool</a> mentioned in part 1 can unofficially show you House of 
Representatives candidates, 
as well as useful historical data, margins, and demographics.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has an article on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidates_of_the_2022_Australian_federal_election#Victoria">
candidates of the 2022 federal election</a>, which includes a list of Senate 
candidates towards the bottom.</p>
<p>Looking for info on your current MPs and senators? <a href="https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/">They Vote For You</a> is an 
invaluable insight into the way they vote in Parliament. You can type in your 
postcode or seat and view information on attendance and their position on a range of policy areas. It's a bit harder to look up current serving senators, but 
you can also find them using
<a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian_Search_Results?q=&amp;sta=VIC&amp;sen=1">
Parliament's directory</a> and input their names directly into the <em>They Vote 
For You</em> search bar.</p>
<h2>But what about their policies?</h2>
<p>Strap on in! Although we don't have an official ballot that we can use to 
create our own informed ranking yet, it pays well to have a read of each party's 
platforms.</p>
<p>This section is currently a work-in-progress; as party pages are completed, 
their links will appear here.</p>
