<h1>3. Understanding the ballot(s)</h1>
<p>Hopefully, you now understand how your vote is used to choose the government; 
you've made sure you're enrolled; and you know where and when to vote. Now, how 
on earth do you fill out the ballot papers?</p>
<h2>DON'T FOLLOW THE HOW-TO-VOTE CARDS!</h2>
<p>When you go to vote, you will most likely be handed cards by volunteers for 
political parties, telling you ‘how to vote’ for them. <strong>Ignore them.</strong></p>
<p>Some people get the idea that their vote is somehow invalid or wrong because 
they haven't followed these cards, but they are merely the preferences <em>the 
parties want</em> you to put after them.</p>
<p>If you want to vote for a particular party, you only have to put their 
candidate first; anything after that is up to you. Remember, you can preference 
the candidates in <em>any order of your choosing</em>.</p>
<p>Don't know who to pick? The next parts of this election guide will acquaint you with the people and parties 
contesting this election, so that come election day, you'll come in with your 
very own ‘how-to-vote’ card with your informed choices on it.</p>
<h2>House of Representatives (the green paper)</h2>
<p>

This one is pretty simple, and usually more like a receipt in size.</p>
<p>Number all the candidates according to your preferred order, with your most 
preferred candidate as 1. Don't overthink it – unlike in the U.S. or U.K., 
there's no need (or reason) to be ‘strategic’ with your vote, and you can't 
‘waste’ it either, since your vote will always flow to another candidate. Nice 
and simple.</p>
<h3>How is it counted?</h3>
<p>The person with the least first preference votes is eliminated, and their 
votes distributed to other candidates according to the second preferences of 
those votes. The process is repeated until a candidate has more than 50% of the 
vote and thus wins.</p>
<h2>Senate (the white paper)</h2>
<p>This shit usually looks like
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Victorian-senate-paper-folded-01.png">
a whole motherfucking table cloth</a> with 6,969 different squares you can pick, 
as a consequence of each state and territory electing multiple senators.</p>
<p>Thankfully, unlike the House of Representatives paper, you don't have to 
number every single candidate, and you've got two ways of voting: by party (<em>above 
the line</em>) or by candidate (<em>below the line</em>). You number at least 
six or twelve of the options, respectively, in your preferred order. It's pretty 
simple.</p>
<p>You might sometimes hear that below the line voting is better than above the 
line voting, but the reasons why have largely disappeared since the 2016 
election. Nowadays, the only reason to vote below the line is if you'd like to 
preference an independent candidate; independents don't belong to parties, and 
generally can't be preferenced above the line (though sometimes a few team up to 
appear as a nameless group).</p>
<p>Also note that you're only voting to pick roughly six senators; half of the 
Senate is elected every three years, so that rather than electing them all in 
one go every six years, the Australian public get to vote on the Senate every 
three years as well.</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>You have two pieces of paper to fill out. The green paper elects the House of 
Representatives and will decide the government. You must number all the boxes.</p>
