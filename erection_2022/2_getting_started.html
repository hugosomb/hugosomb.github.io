<h1>2. Getting started with voting</h1>
<h2>Can I vote?</h2>
<p>You can, if you're:</p>
<ul>
	<li>an Australian citizen, or under certain circumstances, a British 
	subject; and</li>
	<li>18 years old or older.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Registering to vote</h2>
<p>You need to be enrolled to vote. To check if you are, go to
<a href="https://aec.gov.au/check">aec.gov.au/check</a>. It'll ask you for your name and 
address.</p>
<p>If it can't find your details, you most likely aren't enrolled. Go to
<a href="https://aec.gov.au/enrol">aec.gov.au/enrol</a>.</p>
<p>If you've moved recently, you might still be enrolled under your old address. 
If you've lived at your new address for more than a month, you should update 
your details at <a href="https://aec.gov.au/update">aec.gov.au/update</a>.</p>
<p>Side note – when you enrol with the A.E.C., it also automatically enrols you 
with your state's own electoral commission, so you don't have to worry about 
registering for state elections.</p>
<h2>Which division am I in?</h2>
<p>When you check your enrolment using the A.E.C.
<a href="https://aec.gov.au/check">enrolment checker</a>, or when you enrol with them, they should tell you which 
division you are in.</p>
<p>For more information on your division, such as vote margins, historical data, 
candidates, and demographics, the <em>Guardian</em>'s
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2022/apr/10/australian-election-2022-seat-explorer">
seat explorer</a> is a great tool to have. If you don't know your division, the 
seat explorer can also use your browser location to find it.</p>
<h2>Where and when do I vote?</h2>
<p>The election will be held on Saturday 21 May.</p>
<p>The A.E.C. hasn't released its list of polling centres yet. Once it becomes 
available, it will be linked here.</p>
<p>You can also vote early if you can't make it to a polling station on election 
day. A link to the list of early voting centres will likewise be posted here 
once it is released.</p>
