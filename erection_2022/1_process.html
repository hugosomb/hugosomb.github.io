<h1>1. Understanding the process</h1>
<p>(This is a really long, detailed look at the process. You might want to
<a href="#tldr">skip to the TL;DR</a>.)</p>
<p>What's happening at this election?</p>
<p>A bit of background: our country uses the <em>Westminster system</em> of 
government imported from Britain. The entire thing is kind of like a house of 
cards held together by a lot of hope, but surprisingly enough, it's holding quite well.</p>
<p>What's happening is that you’re not actually voting for a Prime Minister. 
You're not even voting for a party. You're voting for people—who usually, but 
not always, happen to belong to parties—to represent you in <em>Parliament</em>, which is where new laws are written, 
debated, and approved. It has three parts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a lower house, called the <em>House of Representatives</em>, made up of 151 
	Members of Parliament (<em>MPs</em>), each elected to a three-year term to represent 
	a <em>division</em> of roughly 100,000 people;</li>
	<li>an upper house, called the <em>Senate</em>, made up of 76 senators, elected to a 
	six-year term to represent the states (which get 12 senators each) and 
	territories (which get 2 senators each); and</li>
	<li>the <em>Governor-General</em>, acting in their Parliamentary role as the 
	<em>Governor-General-in-Parliament</em>, who gives final approval to laws.</li>
</ul>
<aside>
<p>How do we get from electing MPs to choosing the government and a Prime 
Minister, then? To understand this, you've got to take a closer look at the whole 
‘Governor-General’ business.</p>
	<p>Remember, Australia is a monarchy, and the Governor-General—acting as the 
	representative of the <em>Queen</em>—is the embodiment of all 
	government power; a sort of political God mode. This means they're 
	responsible for, among a fuckload of other things, appointing the government 
	and its ministers—including the Prime Minister. However, they are required to remain 
	politically neutral and exercise their powers only according to established 
	conventions.</p>
	<blockquote>‘Gradually over time, the Queen's role has become more and more 
	ceremonial, and she does more and more nothing. Her powers still exist, and 
	in theory the Queen could veto any law she doesn't like. But she knows full 
	well that if she tries to exercise any of her theoretical power, and defy 
	the MPs that we, the people, voted for, there'll be an instant revolution 
	and we'll set her palace on fire.’<br />
	— Jay Foreman</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What conventions do they follow in appointing the government? Well, 
whichever group that forms government needs to have two things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the <em>confidence</em> of the House of Representatives—that is, its support, 
	which basically means having a majority; and</li>
	<li><em>supply</em>, which is support in both houses of Parliament to pass 
	laws allowing the government to have money to function.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this arises two situations. The more common one is a <em>majority 
government</em>, where a party or coalition wins a House of 
Representatives majority by itself. The 
other is a <em>hung parliament</em>, where no party has more than 50% of the 
seats. In that 
case, the<em> crossbench</em> (minor parties and independent MPs) are said to 
hold the <em>balance of power</em>, and the major parties must negotiate with 
crossbench MPs to gain their confidence and supply—in return for promises to 
those MPs—to form a <em>minority government</em>.</p>
<p>Once a group is able to form government, the Governor-General appoints their 
leader as the Prime Minister, who in turn will advise the Governor-General on 
who to appoint to government. If there is deadlock, the Governor-General may call 
another election to break it, though this has never happened in Australian 
history. Likewise, if a government loses the confidence of the lower 
house, or has its supply blocked in either house, the Prime Minister is 
obliged to resign or call another election; should they refuse to do so, the 
Governor-General will fire them (as famously occurred during the 1975 
constitutional crisis).</p>
<p>By convention, the largest non-government group—the runners-up, if you'd 
like—in the House of 
Representatives forms <em>Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition</em>. They form a sort 
of government-in-waiting, with its own <em>shadow ministers</em> and a leader. 
Their job consists mainly of saying ‘this is what <em>we</em> would've done if 
<em>we</em> were in charge…’ and holding 
the government accountable by yelling at them in Parliament and the media.</p>
<p>Note that control of the House of Representatives is necessary to form a 
government, and not the Senate. Due to the way the Senate is elected, it is 
exceedingly rare for any party to win outright control of the Senate (the last 
time was 2005, or 17 years ago), and so negotiation with Senators is usually 
necessary to pass any laws, including supply bills.</p>
<p>Confused yet? Here are some diagrams showing the more likely situations.</p>

<p><a name="tldr">TL;DR: </a>You vote for someone who might belong to a party. 
Whichever party either holds more than 50% of the seats in the House of 
Representatives (Parliament's lower house)—or can convince enough minor party 
MPs and/or independents to support them—forms the government, and their leader 
becomes the Prime Minister.</p>
