<h1>The 2022 Federal Election for Dummies</h1>

<p>If you're reading this, you've probably turned 18 recently. Now comes your 
first big test of adulthood – voting.</p>
<p>In Australia, voting is compulsory, mainly because it's the only way to force 
most of the country to get off their arse and actually do it. Before compulsory 
voting was introduced in the 1920s, turnout would be as low as 20%, because our 
country is full of lazy sods who won't do anything until threatened.</p>
<p>Anyways, here is the guide that I've written for my friends to 
understand how all of this shit works. Hopefully, this will do more informing 
than confusing. The idea is that by the end of this guide, you'll:</p>
<ul>
	<li>understand how your vote is used to elect the government;</li>
	<li>know which division you're in, and where and when to vote;</li>
	<li>be able to fill out the ballot paper;</li>
	<li>know who's running in your division and state; and</li>
	<li>be able to make your own informed ranking of the candidates to take to 
	the polling centre.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be uploaded in chunks over the next week and updated as more 
information and announcements are made available by candidates/parties.</p>
