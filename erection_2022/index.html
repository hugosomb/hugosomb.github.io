<h1>The 2022 Federal Election for Dummies</h1>

<p>If you're reading this, you've probably turned 18 recently. Now comes your 
first big test of adulthood – voting.</p>
<p>In Australia, voting is compulsory, mainly because it's the only way to force 
most of the country to get off their arse and actually do it. Before compulsory 
voting was introduced in the 1920s, turnout would be as low as 20%, because our 
country is full of lazy sods who won't do anything until threatened.</p>
<p>Anyways, here is the guide that I've written for my friends to 
understand how all of this shit works. Hopefully, this will do more informing 
than confusing.</p>
<blockquote><em>“Democracy only works if you work for it.”<br />
	</em>— some fucking nerd</blockquote>
<p>This will be uploaded in chunks over the next week and updated as more 
information and announcements are made available by candidates/parties.</p>
