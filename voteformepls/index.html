<h2>vote for me pls ty</h2>
<p>i would like to announce (before you get to all the other cool stuff to explore in this junkyard of my work) that i am running in this year's victorian general election as an independent candidate for the western metropolitan region of the legislative council.</p>
<p>my policies are obviously the best (no cap), so you should vote for me.</p>
<p>not convinced? have a look through my election platform (ok rn its just an intro thingo), and be amazed or something.</p>
<h2>anyways, here's the aforementioned stuff.</h2>

<h1>Hugo Somboonsin &#8211; independent candidate for Western Melbourne</h1>
<p>It's time for them to sit up and listen.</p>
<p>For far too long, career politicians have taken our vote for granted, neglecting to even consider the backlog of investment in our area's essential needs: housing, education, and transport.</p>
<p>Whether old or young, many ordinary people feel the same sense of disillusionment with politics, and the choices offered to us. The focus and money always goes to wealthier areas, or ideological wankery; else, &lsquo;they&rsquo; are busy bending over backwards for land developers who haven't the slightest interest of anything but their own profit in mind.</p>
<p>On paper, Victoria is one of the most liveable places on the planet, and one of the wealthiest per capita. Yet,</p>
<ul>
  <li>house prices and homelessness are out of control;</li>
  <li>the education system ranks near the bottom of developed nations;</li>
  <li>health services are understaffed and overwhelmed, while mental health services are largely unaffordable;</li>
  <li>and public transport is completely and utterly broken.</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone needs to stand up for the west side, and I hope that this year, I will become that person.</p>
<p>As someone who has spent pretty much all his life here, the policy proposals that I take to you, the electorate, are ones which are elucidated based on real, lived experiences.</p>
<p><em>Please consider voting for me.</em> Thank you.</p>
