<h1>free public transport is a waste of money</h1>

Jun. 14, 2022


<br/><br/>
<p>People don&rsquo;t seem to understand that the greatest barrier to public transport use isn&rsquo;t the cost – especially right now
when fuel prices are sky high. It&rsquo;s the abysmal service.</p>
<p>In my area, trips by public transport can take three times as long to get to a destination
compared to driving (20 min vs 1 hour); people won&rsquo;t magically be enticed to suddenly hop on such a poor service simply
by making it free.</p>
<p>Pre-COVID, PTV fare revenue was approaching a billion dollars a year. Let&rsquo;s assume that by taking away such fare
revenue, Government subsidies must therefore increase by the same billion dollars to make up for the otherwise lost
revenue. Is this really a good use of that money, and what else could we spend it on?</p>
<p>A few years ago the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated it&rsquo;d cost just $200 million to get us trains and trams every
10 minutes seven days a week (6am-9pm) and to run them at max capacity during peak hour, which alone would be a game
changer; and even then you&rsquo;d still have $800 million left. Imagine $800 million pumped into our state&rsquo;s bus networks,
for example – that&rsquo;s the sort of stuff that will actually get people out of their cars and onto public transport.</p>
<p>People of course will make any argument possible against investment or improvement. When I originally wrote these words
as part of a Reddit comment, someone jumped on to say something along the lines of &lsquo;Much analysis has already gone into
public transport schedules, therefore there is no need to improve them.&rsquo; What nonsense! To say analysis has gone into
current operating schedules is a stretch for some modes and quite frankly laughable for others. When it&rsquo;s done, it
happens within the confines that the Department of Transport sets, and it&rsquo;s about operator stuff, like making sure trains
don&rsquo;t conflict; the tendency seems to be that many other considerations are often ignored. And for buses, a lot of them
don&rsquo;t even get reviewed for ages; there are loads of buses in Melbourne with slow, winding, indirect routes as a
carryover from when buses were unregulated, for instance, and they were all competing to drive each other out of business.</p>
<p>People shouldn&rsquo;t have to endure public transport—because endure is what it currently is—just because they don&rsquo;t
own a car. Being convenient for the public is exactly the point: if you provide better quality, more frequent services,
people will use them.</p>
