      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hel_Peninsula&amp;amp;oldid=939640541&#34;&gt;Hel Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; (Polish: Mierzeja Helska) is a 35-km-long sand bar peninsula in northern Poland separating the Bay of Puck from the open Baltic Sea.&#xA;The width of the peninsula varies from approximately 300 m near Jurata, through 100 m in the most narrow part to over 3 km at the tip. Since the peninsula was formed entirely of sand, it is frequently turned into an island by winter storms. Until the 17th century the peninsula was a chain of islands that formed a strip of land only during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Want to get in touch with me, or stalk the rest of my online presence?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-somboonsin-12b28218a/&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; basically just repeats everything I wrote above but more professionally, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wanna look at my music taste? Me neither, but here&amp;rsquo;s my &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/user/heyyyyyyeverybody&#34;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hugssomb&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (@hugssomb) more than I should. &lt;em&gt;I will never call it &amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo; because that is a stupid name.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/hugosomb/&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; (@hugosomb, private).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also on Discord (@hugosomb).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tiktok.com/@hugosomb&#34;&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; (@hugosomb), but it&amp;rsquo;s there, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
