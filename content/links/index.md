Want to get in touch with me, or stalk the rest of my online presence?
 - My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-somboonsin-12b28218a/">LinkedIn</a> basically just repeats everything I wrote above but more professionally, I guess.
 - Wanna look at my music taste? Me neither, but here's my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/heyyyyyyeverybody">Spotify</a>.
 - I use <a href="https://twitter.com/hugssomb">Twitter</a> (@hugssomb) more than I should. *I will never call it 'X' because that is a stupid name.*
 - My <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hugosomb/">Instagram</a> (@hugosomb, private). 
 - I'm also on Discord (@hugosomb).
 - I don't really use <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hugosomb">TikTok</a> (@hugosomb), but it's there, I guess.
