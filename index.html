<h1>the unattainable invariably is attractive</h1>
<p>welcome to my (hugo somboonsin's) website. this is where i publish a bunch of stuff that i 
make.</p>
<h2>vote for me pls ty</h2>
<p>i would like to announce (before you get to all the other cool stuff to explore in this junkyard of my work) that i am running in this year's victorian general election as an independent candidate for the western metropolitan region of the legislative council.</p>
<p>my policies are obviously the best (no cap), so you should vote for me.</p>
<p>not convinced? have a look through <a href="voteformepls/index.html">my election platform</a> (ok rn its just an intro thingo), and be amazed or something.</p>
<h2>anyways, here's the aforementioned stuff.</h2>
<ul>
	<li>some <a href="essays/index.html">essays</a>, most of which are rather rambly.</li>
    <li>sometimes i like to make <a href="maps/index.html">maps</a> (well really 
      they're just diagrams). here they are.</li>
    <li>i take lots of analogue photos (film!!!), and i think <a href="film/index.html">some of them</a> are cool.</li>
    <li>i have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyuDROQgOF2HrPKqaDjRJUw">youtube channel</a> but there's like two videos on it, all of which are vce copium. fuck vce.</li>
    <li>i'm on discord (hugs#6131) and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hugosomb/">instagram</a> (@hugosomb, private). i also have <a href="https://twitter.com/hugssomb">twitter</a> (@hugssomb) and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hugosomb">tiktok</a> (@hugosomb), but i don't use those as often.</li>
    <li>at one point i was working on <a href="erection_2022/index.html">a guide to the 
	2022 general election</a>. i kinda gave up on that. besides, you know how it ended up going.</li>
