      they're just diagrams). here they are.</li>
    <li>i take lots of analogue photos (film!!!), and i think <a href="film/index.html">some of them</a> are cool.</li>
    <li>i have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyuDROQgOF2HrPKqaDjRJUw">youtube channel</a> but there's like two videos on it, all of which are vce copium. fuck vce.</li>
    <li>i have <a href="https://twitter.com/hugssomb">twitter</a> (@hugssomb) (i will never call it 'X' because that is a stupid name). i'm also on discord (hugs#6131), <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hugosomb/">instagram</a> (@hugosomb, private), and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hugosomb">tiktok</a> (@hugosomb).</li>
