<h1>we can't afford free public transport</h1>
    <p><em>Another Reddit comment series on public transport and urban planning. Here you go.</em></p>
    <p>People don't seem to understand that the greatest barrier to public transport use isn't the cost – especially right now when fuel prices are sky high. It's the abysmal service. People will not use a service that, for example, in my area, can take three times as long to get to a destination compared to a car (20 min vs 1 hour).</p>
    <p>Pre-COVID, PTV fare revenue was approaching a billion dollars a year, and there's way better things a government could do if they wanted to invest a billion dollars in public transport. A few years ago the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated it'd cost just $200 million to get us trains and trams every 10 minutes seven days a week (6am-9pm) and to run them at max capacity during peak hour, which alone would be a game changer; and even then you'd still have $800 million left. Imagine $800 million pumped into our state's bus networks – that's the sort of stuff that will actually get people out of their cars and onto public transport.</p>
    <p>The assumption is that given that the government earns $1 billion from fares, should you take it away, you would need $1 billion in extra funding to make up for the shortfall. The assumptions here are deliberately simplistic and it's more to make a point of 'what could be a better use of that much extra money on something public transport-related?'</p>
    <p>To say analysis has gone into current operating schedules is a stretch. When it's done, it happens within the confines that the Department of Transport sets, and it's about operator stuff, like making sure trains don't conflict; the tendency seems to be that many other considerations are often ignored. And for buses, a lot of them don't even get reviewed for ages; there are loads of buses in Melbourne with slow, winding, indirect routes as a carryover from when buses were unregulated, for instance.</p>
    <p>In any case, public transport is a right that isn't meant to be profit-making, in the same vein as health care or public housing. People shouldn't have to endure public transport—because endure is what it currently is—just because they don't own a car. Being convenient for the public is exactly the point: if you provide better quality, more frequent services, people will use them.</p>
